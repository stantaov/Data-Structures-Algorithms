### Max and Min in a Unsorted Array

In this problem, we will look for smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers. The code should run in O(n) time. Do not use Python's inbuilt functions to find min and max.

### Solution, Time and Space Complexity Analysis

The first step in this algorithm is to declare max and min variables and next it iterates through the target list and updates max and min variables. After the traversal is complete the algorithm returns max and min values of the target list. Therefore the time complexity is O(n) with space complexity is O(1) since the algorithm uses the same set of variables to store the data.
