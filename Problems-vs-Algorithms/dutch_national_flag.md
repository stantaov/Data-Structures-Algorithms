### Dutch National Flag Problem

Given an input array consisting on only 0, 1, and 2, sort the array in a single traversal. You're not allowed to use any sorting function that Python provides.

Note: O(n) does not necessarily mean single-traversal. For e.g. if you traverse the array twice, that would still be an O(n) solution but it will not count as single traversal.

### Solution, Time and Space Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the solution is O(n) since it sorts the list in a single pass. The space complexity is O(1) since the algorithm uses the same variables to store data.
