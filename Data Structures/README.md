## Data Structures Project

The project contains the fllowing problems:

1. Least Recently Used Cache
2. Finding Files
3. Huffman Data Compression
4. Active Directory
5. Blockchain
6. Union and Intersection of Two Linked Lists

### Least Recently Used Cache

For our first problem, the goal will be to design a data structure known as a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. An LRU cache is a type of cache in which we remove the least recently used entry when the cache memory reaches its limit. 

### Finding Files

For this problem, the goal is to write code for finding all files under a directory (and all directories beneath it) that end with ".c"

./testdir
./testdir/subdir1
./testdir/subdir1/a.c
./testdir/subdir1/a.h
./testdir/subdir2
./testdir/subdir2/.gitkeep
./testdir/subdir3
./testdir/subdir3/subsubdir1
./testdir/subdir3/subsubdir1/b.c
./testdir/subdir3/subsubdir1/b.h
./testdir/subdir4
./testdir/subdir4/.gitkeep
./testdir/subdir5
./testdir/subdir5/a.c
./testdir/subdir5/a.h
./testdir/t1.c
./testdir/t1.h

### Huffman Data Compression

Assume that we have a string message AAAAAAABBBCCCCCCCDDEEEEEE comprising of 25 characters to be encoded. The string message can be an unsorted one as well. We will have two phases in encoding - building the Huffman tree (a binary tree), and generating the encoded data. Once we have the encoded data, and the (pointer to the root of) Huffman tree, we can easily decode the encoded data using the following steps:

Declare a blank decoded string
Pick a bit from the encoded data, traversing from left to right.
Start traversing the Huffman tree from the root.
If the current bit of encoded data is 0, move to the left child, else move to the right child of the tree if the current bit is 1.
If a leaf node is encountered, append the (alphabetical) character of the leaf node to the decoded string.
Repeat steps #2 and #3 until the encoded data is completely traversed.

### Active Directory

In Windows Active Directory, a group can consist of user(s) and group(s) themselves. We can construct this hierarchy as such. Where User is represented by str representing their ids. A function that provides an efficient look up of whether the user is in a group.

### Blockchain

A Blockchain is a sequential chain of records, similar to a linked list. Each block contains some information and how it is connected related to the other blocks in the chain. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. For our blockchain we will be using a SHA-256 hash, the Greenwich Mean Time when the block was created, and text strings as the data.

### Union and Intersection of Two Linked Lists

The task for this problem is to fill out the union and intersection functions. The union of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in A, in B, or in both A and B. The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A âˆ© B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B.

Take in two linked lists and return a linked list that is composed of either the union or intersection, respectively. Once you have completed the problem you will create your own test cases and perform your own run time analysis on the code.
